# Business Intelligence Solution for SecureBank

This repository contains a Business Intelligence (BI) solution for **SecureBank**, focusing on the analysis of phishing simulation data. The project features three Microsoft Power BI dashboards designed for three distinct stakeholders: the **Phishing Campaign Manager**, **HR Manager**, and **IT Security Team**. These dashboards aim to enhance decision-making and improve cybersecurity efforts by providing actionable insights from phishing simulation results.

## Project Overview
In the digital age, phishing remains one of the most prevalent and damaging threats to organizational security. To combat this, SecureBank initiated simulated phishing campaigns across its workforce. The goal of this project is to provide a data-driven BI solution to help the bank's key stakeholders monitor, assess, and act on phishing risks more effectively.

### Dashboards Developed:
1. **Phishing Campaign Manager Dashboard**: 
   - Tracks overall exposure by monitoring who clicked phishing links and entered credentials.
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of each campaign over time.
   - Identifies departments at higher risk and employee reporting behavior.

2. **HR Manager Dashboard**:
   - Monitors employee training completion and compliance.
   - Identifies high-risk job roles and departments.
   - Highlights repeat offenders and correlates training completion with improved behavior.

3. **IT Security Team Dashboard**:
   - Monitors the volume and timing of IT responses to phishing incidents.
   - Provides insights into the types of IT actions taken.
   - Tracks response time and ensures timely intervention.

## Objectives
The objective of these dashboards is to reduce phishing vulnerabilities by providing clear, actionable insights for each stakeholder group:
- **Phishing Campaign Manager**: Use the insights to improve the design and timing of phishing simulations.
- **HR Manager**: Focus on training engagement and identify high-risk employees who need further intervention.
- **IT Security Team**: Streamline response times and ensure timely mitigation of phishing risks.

## Benefits of the Solution
- **Stakeholder-Specific Insights**: Each dashboard is tailored to provide the most relevant insights for each role.
- **Proactive Identification of High-Risk Behavior**: Identifies employees or departments at higher risk of falling for phishing scams.
- **Improved IT Incident Response**: Real-time monitoring of IT response times to ensure quick and efficient actions.

## Data Used
The analysis is based on a synthetic dataset that reflects phishing simulation data. The dataset includes employee engagement metrics, training completion, phishing interaction, and IT response data.

## Power BI Dashboards
The repository includes visual representations (screenshots) of the Power BI dashboards developed for the three stakeholder groups. Each dashboard consists of at least four key visualizations.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open Power BI and load the dataset (or create similar synthetic data).
3. Import the PBIX files to visualize the dashboards.

## Assumptions
- All employees belong to a single department and have one job title.
- Training status is updated per simulation.
- Security actions are logged only for employees who interact with phishing emails.

## Recommendations
- **Phishing Campaign Manager**: Tailor phishing simulations based on department-specific threats.
- **HR Manager**: Implement role-specific micro-training for high-risk job roles.
- **IT Security Team**: Optimize response workflows and improve SLA tracking for faster mitigation.

## Certificate of Completion
This report is accompanied by a certificate of completion for the **Power BI Essential Training** course from LinkedIn Learning, which has been incorporated into the solution.
